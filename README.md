## Introduction
There are a lot of factors that are important for opening and running a successful restaurant. The most important one of them is location. Location is the key and it is as important as menu and concept of a restaurant. First of all we have to decide that which part of the city do we want to open our restaurant. Beside the location there are a couple of other factors to be considered. such as how much is the population of the chosen area and what is the income of the people who live there. Based on these two consideration we can decide on the theme and price of the restaurant. Also there are places that may not have a big population of habitant but if it's a business centre it can make a big change. For example places like city centre or the centres of entertainment have always benefits even though a lot of other restaurants may exist in those areas. Another consideration is that if we want to open a pie shop we may prefer not to open it in an area that another ten pie shops exist.
