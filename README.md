## Introduction
This is a guide to open a restaurant in Canberra. There are a lot of factors that are important for opening and running a successful restaurant. The most important one of them is location. Location is the key and it is as important as menu and concept of a restaurant. First of all we have to decide that which part of the city do we want to open our restaurant. Beside the location there are a couple of other factors to be considered. such as how much is the population of the chosen area and what is the income of the people who live there. Based on these two considerations we can also decide on the theme and price of the restaurant. Also there are places that may not have a big population of habitants but if it's a business centre it can make a big difference. For example places like city centre(like Civic) or the centres of entertainment(like Manuka) have always benefits even though a lot of other restaurants may exist in those areas. Another consideration is that if we want to open a pie shop we may prefer not to open it in an area that another ten pie shops exist. In this project we try to find the best places for opening a successful restaurant.

## Data

For this project, the following factors have to be extracted from various data sources:
-	Percentage of the Australian Capital Territory population for each suburb (Canberra Census)
- Median weekly personal income (Canberra Census)
-	Number of Restaurants in Each Neighborhood (Foursquare API)
The Canberra Census data was extracted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbs_of_Canberra
